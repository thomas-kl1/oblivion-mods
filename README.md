# My Custom Mods

## Kvatch Soldier

This mod introduce a new Kvatch soldier cuirass.  
The cuirass has now reinforced plates on the lower body and reinforced pauldrons.  
The elements are copied from the iron cuirass, but their texture have been modified to look more "used".

The Kvatch townguards have now iron boot, gauntlets and greaves.  
The iron guantlets and graves for the Kvatch guars is a custom item.  
It's the same as vanilla iron, expect that the female variation is now identical to mens.  
Indeed, she desverse the same amount of protection after all ;) (iron greaves is a skirt, and iron gauntlets looks weirds with no plate at all).

I you install the mod after the Kvatch charactes have already been loaded in your save, you may not see the changes.  
You can resurrect the models or wait for a natural refresh.  

The custom Kvatch solider cuirass is not added to the characters. If you want to have it, you need to add it via the cli.  
You can find the ID by exploring the mod items thanks to TES Construction Set. You will need to get the mod ID too.  
For that you need the Oblivion Mod Manager tool. To add the item you need to run the player.additem command and replace the first two digit of the item ID by the mod ID. 

## Champion of Kvatch

This mod is originally inspired by the "Hero of Kvatch Armour Set" mode, made by Jannix Quinn.  
You can find it [here](https://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/oblivion/mods/9/armurerie/armes_et_armures/larmure_du_heros_de_kvatch).

What I did:

- Fixed the helmet issue by adding the missing egm file so the helmet can fit any head size model
- Reworked the texture on the cuirass (before, the normal map was the vanilla Kvatch townguard cuirass, added some missing details)
- Reworked the colors on the textures (almost every piece of the set, many the helmet and cuirass)
- Resized the wolf emblem on the cuirass and other textures and bormal improvements (thanks Jean-Baptiste Klein)
- Added the pauldrons on the cuirass (I'm using the Legion pauldrons from the cuirass)
- Reworked completely the shield to be closer to the vanilla shield
- Replaced the sword, it's now the same normal as the vanilla fine steel longsword, but I added the wolf emblem on the sword pommel
- The set is available on the corpse of the count's bodyguard (so not in a chest next to the throne as the original mod). The corpse is in the count's appartments, next to the count's corpse (sorry for the spoil).

So basically I stuck the idea of having a mixed set of Legion parts and the Kvatch townguard cuirass, but improved.
However I've swamped the shield and sword by new ones.
